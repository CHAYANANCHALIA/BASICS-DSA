        No, the statement int $ = 24; will not produce any errors in Java.

In Java, variable names can consist of letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Therefore, int $ = 24; is a valid declaration in Java, where $ is the name of the variable and it is assigned the value 24.
